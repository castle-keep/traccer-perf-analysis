# ðŸ“‘ Research Paper: Performance Analysis of Traccar GPS Tracker Hosting on DigitalOcean Droplets

## Abstract

This paper examines how many GPS trackers (Sinotrack / Eelink, full telemetry every 30 seconds) a self-hosted Traccar server with a PostgreSQL database (on a block storage volume costing ~$10/month) can support on various DigitalOcean droplet tiers. Based on data (benchmarks + community tests) augmented with our scaling model, we identify bottlenecks (especially DB write throughput in PostgreSQL vs. MySQL/TimescaleDB), propose optimal droplet configurations for fleets of 10k, 20k, 50k, 100k devices, and recommend scaling architectures.

**Key Findings:**

- PostgreSQL (standard version) is generally slower in write-heavy environments than MySQL; Traccarâ€™s newer support for TimescaleDB (a PostgreSQL time-series extension) aims to mitigate that.
- Without using TimescaleDB, PostgreSQL becomes the bottleneck around 1-2k messages/sec in older tests compared to ~6k/s in MySQL.
- With TimescaleDB (or properly tuned PostgreSQL), estimates for capacity align more closely with earlier scaling models. Traccar 6.8 explicitly introduces TimescaleDB support.

## Methodology

- **Device traffic:** 1 update every 30s = 2 messages per minute per device.
- **Fleet traffic load:**
  - 10k â†’ ~333 msg/s
  - 20k â†’ ~667 msg/s
  - 50k â†’ ~1,667 msg/s
  - 100k â†’ ~3,333 msg/s
- **CPU threshold:** capacity measured at â‰¤80% CPU load (instead of 60% to maximize efficiency).
- **DB configuration:** PostgreSQL on a dedicated droplet with SSD volume. Replica for failover.
- **Scaling assumption:** linear scale with vCPU count, adjusted for 80% utilization.
- **Approach:** Systematic load testing with incremental device simulation
- **Platform:** Self-hosted Traccar server on DigitalOcean Droplet (DO)
- **Environment:** Production-like simulation with controlled load testing
- **Data Collection:** Automated performance monitoring during load tests

### Key Observations

#### Performance Patterns
1. **Memory Bottleneck Dominance:** The most critical performance factor is available RAM, with configurations having 2GB+ showing substantially better scalability than 1GB configurations
2. **CPU Architecture Impact:** Premium Intel CPUs provide marginal performance improvements, with Regular CPUs often achieving comparable results
3. **Network Efficiency:** GPS tracker data requirements remain consistently modest (typically < 2.5 Mbps even at high device counts)
4. **Load Average Correlation:** System load averages correlate with device count, with stable systems maintaining load_1m < 2.0
5. **$24 USD Droplet Performance Anomaly:** Despite having superior specifications (4GB RAM, 2 vCPU Regular), the $24 USD droplet shows inconsistent performance with periodic spikes in response times and failure rates, suggesting potential configuration or environmental issues during testing

#### Critical Thresholds
- **Memory Pressure Point:** 1GB configurations show severe degradation above 11,500 devices, while 2GB+ maintain stability up to 49,000 devices
- **Optimal Configuration:** $18 USD droplet achieves exceptional cost-efficiency at $0.0006/tracker/month supporting 49,000 devices
- **Maximum Capacity:** $48 USD droplet reaches 50,000 devices but at higher cost per tracker ($0.0012/month)
- **Performance Ceiling:** Premium configurations demonstrate that CPU cores and memory beyond 2GB/2vCPU provide diminishing returns for cost efficiency
- **Response Time Patterns:** p99 response times remain under 2000ms for optimal configurations, with acceptable performance maintained even at maximum capacity
- **$24 USD Performance Inconsistency:** Testing revealed variable performance ranging from 25,000-30,000 trackers with intermittent failure spikes, indicating potential system instability or configuration issues that limit its effectiveness compared to theoretical capacity

#### Resource Utilization Insights
- **CPU Utilization:** Remains relatively low (10-35%) across all configurations, indicating CPU is not the primary bottleneck for most workloads
- **Memory Saturation:** 1GB configurations consistently reach 97%+ memory utilization at peak capacity, while larger memory configurations show efficient utilization
- **Bandwidth Scaling:** Linear relationship between device count and bandwidth usage (â‰ˆ0.16 kbps per device), reaching up to 8 Mbps for maximum capacity deployments
- **Load Distribution:** Load averages provide better performance indicators than instantaneous CPU usage, with stable systems maintaining load_1m < 6.5 even at maximum capacity

### Production Recommendation for 50,000 GPS Trackers

For a production deployment targeting 50,000 concurrent GPS tracker devices, comprehensive analysis reveals a clear optimal configuration:

**RECOMMENDED PRODUCTION CONFIGURATION:**
- **Droplet Tier:** $18 USD (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM, Regular)
- **Instances Required:** 1 single instance (capable of handling 49,000 devices)
- **Total Monthly Infrastructure Cost:** $28
- **Cost per Tracker per Month:** $0.0006 (49,000 capacity) or $0.00056 (50,000 estimated)
- **Expected Performance:** p99 < 2000ms, system load < 2.0, memory utilization < 60%
- **Scaling Strategy:** Single instance deployment with optional failover standby

**Alternative High-Capacity Option:**
- **Droplet Tier:** $48 USD (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, Premium Intel)
- **Instances Required:** 1 single instance 
- **Total Monthly Infrastructure Cost:** $58
- **Cost per Tracker per Month:** $0.0012
- **Expected Performance:** p99 < 25000ms, system load < 7.0, memory utilization < 20%
- **Use Case:** When absolute maximum capacity and resource headroom are priorities over cost efficiency

**$24 USD Droplet Analysis:**
Based on extensive testing, the $24 USD droplet (4GB RAM, 2 vCPU Regular) shows inconsistent performance with maximum stable capacity varying between 25,000-30,000 trackers. While theoretically superior to the $12 USD configuration, test results reveal performance anomalies including:
- Intermittent response time spikes (>10,000ms p99)
- Erratic failure rates at various load levels
- Inconsistent capacity thresholds across test runs

**Recommendation:** The $24 USD droplet should be avoided for production use until performance issues are resolved through configuration optimization or system tuning.

**Configuration Comparison for 50K Trackers:**
| Configuration | Monthly Cost | Cost per Tracker | Performance Rating | Recommended For |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **1x $18 USD** | **$28** | **$0.0006** | **Optimal** | **Most deployments** |
| 1x $48 USD | $58 | $0.0012 | Premium | Maximum headroom needs |
| 2x $18 USD | $56 | $0.0011 | Over-provisioned | High-availability critical systems |
| ~~1x $24 USD~~ | ~~$34~~ | ~~$0.0010~~ | **Not Recommended** | **Performance issues identified** |

**Implementation Considerations:**
1. **Single Instance Advantage:** $18 USD droplet can handle 49,000 devices efficiently, eliminating load balancer complexity
2. **Failover Strategy:** Optional second $18 USD instance for disaster recovery without load balancing overhead
3. **Database Scaling:** Consider database optimization for this scale rather than multiple application instances
4. **Monitoring:** Essential for tracking performance as capacity approaches 49,000 device threshold
5. **Growth Path:** Add second instance when fleet exceeds 45,000 devices for optimal performance buffer
