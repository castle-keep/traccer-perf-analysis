# Performance Analysis of Traccar GPS Tracking on DigitalOcean Droplets

**A Comprehensive Study of Server Performance, Scaling Characteristics, and Infrastructure Optimization**

---

## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive performance analysis of Traccar GPS tracking servers deployed on various DigitalOcean Droplet configurations. The study evaluates system performance under simulated load conditions using real-world device connection patterns, measuring key metrics including latency, throughput, failure rates, and resource utilization. Through systematic testing across seven different droplet tiers ($6-$48/month), we identify optimal configurations for different deployment scales and provide actionable recommendations for production deployments.

Our analysis reveals that the $24/month droplet tier (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM) offers the best cost-performance balance for deployments up to 15,000-20,000 concurrent devices, while the $48/month tier can reliably handle 30,000+ devices. The study demonstrates clear performance degradation patterns at scale, with failure rates increasing sharply beyond capacity thresholds and latency spikes indicating system saturation. These findings provide crucial guidance for infrastructure planning and scaling decisions in GPS tracking deployments.

## Methodology

### Test Environment and Setup

Our performance analysis is based on empirical data collected from live Traccar server deployments on DigitalOcean Droplets in the Singapore region (SGP1), chosen for optimal latency to Philippines-based GPS devices. Each test environment consists of:

- **Traccar Server**: Self-hosted with default configurations and full telemetry logging
- **Database**: MySQL database on attached block storage volumes (100GB, ~$10/month)
- **Test Framework**: Python-based simulation scripts mimicking real GPS tracker behavior
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics collection including system resources, network usage, and application performance

### Test Parameters and Approach

The testing methodology follows a systematic approach designed to identify performance thresholds and scaling characteristics:

**Device Simulation Protocol:**
- Each simulated device maintains persistent TCP/UDP connections
- Location updates transmitted every 30 seconds (industry standard frequency)
- Full telemetry payloads including GPS coordinates, speed, battery status, and sensor data
- Gradual scaling from 1,000 to 50,000 concurrent devices per droplet configuration

**Performance Measurement Criteria:**
- **Throughput**: Requests per second (RPS) and successful transaction rates
- **Latency**: Response time percentiles (P50, P90, P99) measured end-to-end
- **Reliability**: Failure ratios and error patterns under increasing load
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU usage, memory consumption, load averages, and network bandwidth
- **Saturation Thresholds**: Load average approaching vCPU count indicating system limits

**Test Duration and Methodology:**
- Each load level maintained for 30-second intervals to ensure steady-state measurements
- Multiple test runs per configuration to validate consistency and identify variance
- Real-time monitoring of system metrics synchronized with application performance data
